# tiny-sproto
A simple Point-to-Point Protocol implementation written in Go.

This implementation was built to be used with serial (UART RS-232) for interoperation
between a embedded linux running Go and a raspberry pi pico running Tinygo.

See [Eli's blogpost](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/12/framing-in-serial-communications) for invaluable
information on framing in serial protocols.
